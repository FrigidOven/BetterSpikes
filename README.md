# Better Spikes

A mod for Minecract Better than Adventure that changes the spike trap to behave more similarly to modern Minecraft's magma block.

## Changes

1. Any entity standing stationary on a spike trap will now continue to take damage.
2. Crouching on a spike trap (once you are no longer stuck on it) will negate all damage

These changes make the spike trap much more reliable for mob farms.
